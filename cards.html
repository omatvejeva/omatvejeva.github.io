        This project was an exploration of the <b>hostile architecture</b> we encounter on a daily basis, and how it discourages certain acts or behaviors in public areas. We were challenged to analyze hostile architecture and its exclusive intents and create a human-centred, innovative design to aid and reclaim public spaces for the communityâ€™s well-being. 
        We were challenged to create a prototype for the intended space and show how it would aid the community.

        For this project, the focus is on material exploration and the materiality of a chosen material. We experimented and documented the changes of our chosen material as it comes into contact with outside stimuli or is put under pressure. 

    Alongside the experimentation, we conducted research to better understand the material we were working with. After conducting the research and experimentation, we created a handheld prototype that showed off the materiality of the material.

      This project was an exploration of reclaiming urban spaces with community gardens. We researched an urban site that would benefit from being used as a community garden and conducted research on the social, environmental, and urban planning of said proposed community gardens. 
    Also, I created a digital floor plan for my proposed garden with a focus on accessibility and sustainability of the design.
