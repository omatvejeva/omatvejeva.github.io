                Phase 0: Talking to a Design Professor </h3>

                Upon creating my first iteration of this portfolio and proudly showing it off to my friends and a few professors, I showed it to my design professor and she gave me some hard advice that I needed to hear. She was impressed that I had coded it myself but she said that it was average and ok for a student. This did not feel nice in the moment but I did need to hear it. I got some recommendations and she talked me through what would make a better UI/UX portfolio.
The other twist was that I wanted to have a working prototype for the next week due to a career fair, meaning I had a weekend for this sprint, to restart and have a working prototype.

                  Taking the advice and examples I was given as well as finding more examples online, I sat down and noted what I liked, what worked, and what didn’t work in the portfolios I saw. From there I created a mind map and card sorted the information I wanted to display in my portfolio.

                    With the mind map and card sorting, I had an idea of the sections I wanted to add into my portfolio. I drew out a sketch on a whiteboard to better visualize the flow.

                <p class=" text-gray-600"> 
                    Having a whiteboard sketch (low-fi prototype), I was able to talk to my peers and walk through what I was imagining. Their input helped me revise my low-fi prototype until information was effectively and clearly being communicated.

                With a solid plan of what to make, the next phase was to code. Starting out with a basic framework and reusing what could be salvaged from my original design, I rebuilt my portfolio.

                Having spent less than a week on a redesign and recode, I am happy with how it turned out. I knew from the start that my primary goal with Version 1 was to have a working portfolio I would be able to show off and I knew was usable. A revision was necessary as there were bugs and other usability issues I would need to sort out.
